# fast-eslint-8 package

Lightweight eslint v8.x linter plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on fast-eslint.  

This is a migration of [fast-eslint](https://github.com/arnaud-dezandee/fast-eslint/) from using
eslint 7.10 to eslint 8.x (see [package.json](https://github.com/db-developer/fast-eslint-8)).  
While upgrading from eslint 7.10 to eslint 7.12 produces the most significant changes in code,
further upgrading to eslint 8.x results in the most significant linter changes.

Many thanks to Arnaud Dezandee, who is the creator of [fast-eslint](https://github.com/arnaud-dezandee/fast-eslint/). My migration would not have been able without his project. Due to my personal impatience, I simply did not want to wait for an update that utilizes eslint 8.  
Feel free to copy the changed code and reintegrate it into fast-eslint.
