# Installing fast-eslint-8

Atoms 'flight-manual' provides a detailed description of what <code>atom packages</code> are and how to handle them. If you are interested, [follow this link](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages).  
If you prefer a brief instruction of how to install <code>fast-eslint-8</code>, simply read on here.

## User-friendly

Open your <code>atom</code> editor and switch to the menu.  

![atom settings-short](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2765933/158047464-9f39a5c5-d460-426e-8415-45339c2028e0.png)  

This will open the ![atom fast-eslint-8 settings-tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2765933/156207814-8cb06045-2982-4c0a-9270-10968f55f50e.png)-Tab. Click on 'install' and type 'fast-eslint-8' into the searchbox.  


Click on 'install' ... wait ... and confirm the installation of dependencies. (Dependencies are, in fact, a wrong wording, as they are REQUIRED for fast-eslint-8 to function.)  

You're all set. Switch to your project, open a javascript file and (maybe) start fixing eslinter errors.

## Advanced

This guide assumes, that you are familiar with the use of [apm (atom package manager)](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/#command-line)

<code>apm install fast-eslint-8@latest</code>
